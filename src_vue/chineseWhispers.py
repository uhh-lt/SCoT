############ NEW CHINESE WHISPERS-LABEL PROP (SCOTTI) #######################

# Adjusted version of Chinese Whispers as a Label-Propagation-Learning-Algorithm
# Chineses Whispers cumulates edge-weights per node and class - 
# and allocates the neighbouring node-class with the highest cumulated weight to the node
# the label-prop version - only works on the unlabeled nodes and does not change pre-allocated labels
# PARAM: new_nodes: list of unlabeled nodes
# PARAM: graph - graph with nodes and edges - also the unlabeled nodes need to have feature "class" 
# PRECONDITION: class-Values of unlabeled nodes in graph need to be different to each other and different to all other class values
