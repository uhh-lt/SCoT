# SCoT
SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. 

You will find a detailed explanation of the theoretical background, the architecture and usage examples in the following paper
Haase, Anwar, Yimam, Friedrich, Biemann (2021 - under consideration for EACL - Demo Paper)

This is the second version of the tool, which has been fundamentally revised from the first version that was initially developed by 
Kempfert, Anwar, Yimam and Biemann. The revisions include:
- a fully revised and new graph-model of so-called Neighbourhood Graphs over Time, including new graph-building algorithms, stemming from Haase's MA Thesis 
- a fully new designed frontend
- a fully revised new architecture of the application, including a new MVVM-frontend-component-layering (Vue.js) and a three-layer backend (Python)
- the ability to include features from multiple DTs and full text search via SQL and ElasticSearch-Databases
- the ability to connect multiple databases,
- various improved details in the application, including Docker-deployment details
- new examples related to the research on linguistic polysemies and conceptual history (See paper and further publications in paper)
