# SCoT
SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a word had at different points in time.

The software was expanded, redesigned and update by Christian Haase (HITeC). It includes a mayor revision of the frontend (Vue, d3-JS), new features (context information, multidatabase-connection) and revisions to the backend, including an overhaul of the Python-REST-API. The initial version was mainly developed by Inga Kempfert.
